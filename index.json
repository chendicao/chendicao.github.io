The field of machine learning has grown rapidly over the past few years and practitioners can inject machine learning to agriculture applications. The affordable consumer-grade cameras have brought about a profound advancement of image processing methods. The elliptical cylinder model performs great on the variety ofwheat seed samples including milo and whea.t. For the number of slices selection, the error rate is below 3% on selected reference objects when we choose N=50 number of slices or above. Due to the lack of the seed image processing framework for volume measurement in the agriculture field, we proposed a framework that can calculate the seed volume by measuring its cross-section using two cameras to gather image information. First, we set up a turntable with two cameras: the main view and side view. Next, we turn on the seed feeder and turntable, and our framework captures pictures for one single seed dynamically. Then, our model makes image analysis on two images of one seed and displays the result in real-time through the framework. Combining knowledge of seed image analysis, our proposed framework performs state of the art imaging processing model on seed analysis and achieves rapid measurement of seed volume. The results of proposed volume measurements using wheat seed samples are compared with several image-based volume measurements, and the impact of different experiment design is also analyzed. This framework significantly improves the efficiency in the field of seed property analysis for the researchers.\n","date":1610664816,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610664816,"objectID":"7d23a1740c04b0c94615acca0a1f9723","permalink":"/project/proj5/","publishdate":"2021-01-14T16:53:36-06:00","relpermalink":"/project/proj5/","section":"project","summary":"ABASE","tags":[],"title":"Single Wheat Seed Volume Measurements as Estimated from Orthogonal Top and Side Images.","type":"project"},{"authors":["Chendi Cao and Mitchell L.

It is important to accurately predict the amount of erosion, peak discharge, and the resulting downstream flow. This paper presents a new model based on the material point method to simulate soil and water interaction and predict failure rate parameters. The model assumes that the dam consists of a homogeneous embankment constructed with cohesive soil, and water inflow is defined by a hydrograph using other readily available reach routing software. The model uses continuum mixture theory to describe each phase where each species individually obeys the conservation of mass and momentum. A two-grid material point method is used to discretize the governing equations. The Drucker–Prager plastic flow model, combined with a Hencky strain-based hyperelasticity model, is used to compute soil stress. Water is modeled as a weakly compressible fluid. Analysis of the model demonstrates the efficacy of our approach for existing examples of overtopping dam breach, dam failures, and collisions. Simulation results from our model are compared with a physical-based breach model, WinDAM C. The new model can capture water and soil interaction at a finer granularity than WinDAM C. The new model gradually removes the granular material during the breach process. The impact of material properties on the dam breach process is also analyzed.\n","date":1610664710,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610664710,"objectID":"9f1909d0e540430dde118e3975f619a2","permalink":"/project/proj4/","publishdate":"2021-01-14T16:51:50-06:00","relpermalink":"/project/proj4/","section":"project","summary":"Computation","tags":[],"title":"Dam Breach Simulation with Material Point Method","type":"project"},{"authors":["Chendi Cao and Mitchell L.

Even simple measures such as volume and density can be challenging to compute efficiently with modest equipment. Accurately measuring seed volume becomes a highly under-constrained problem. Multiple images from different perspectives are required.\nThis paper presents an efficient and affordable 3D single seed volume measurement system to extract image contours and compute volumes using a modified volume carving method in a controlled lab environment. The framework is constructed with a turntable, a stepper motor controlled by an Arduino microcontroller, three orthogonal cameras, and camera control via a modest computer used for data acquisition and processing. For testing, images are captured using only a side camera from different angles by rotating the turntable. Then, the framework processes the multiple images in parallel and reconstructs 3D seed objects to calculate the volume based on the voxel numbers. The proposed framework: (1) generates single seed 3D geometries for visualization, (2) calculates precise seed volumes within seconds, and (3) achieves less than a 3% error rate on a reference ceramic sphere.\n","date":1579027233,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579027233,"objectID":"e8f8d235e8e7f2efd912bfe865363fc3","permalink":"/project/example/","publishdate":"2020-01-14T12:40:33-06:00","relpermalink":"/project/example/","section":"project","summary":"CSCI2020","tags":null,"title":"Efficient Seed Volume Measurement Framework","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math  Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

Subsequent modules perform dam breach analysis. Current work is underway to include analysis of internal erosion, non-homogeneous, zoned embankments, and the analysis of various other forms of embankment protection.

Effective implementation of these algorithms on high-performance computers requires knowledge and techniques from mathematics, statistics, and several areas in computer science including parallel computing, compilers, and theory.

In this paper, we propose a new framework to solve these problems. The framework is scalable and extensible, and it can be used to execute jobs either locally and on a cluster as needed.
